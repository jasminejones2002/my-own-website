                Hello! My name is Jasmine Jones and I am 21 years old. I am new to programming, but I am excited to keep learning and growing as I progress. I have 2 dogs, Bella and Cookie. Bella lives with me while cookie lives with my parents. I grew up in Odessa, Tx with my parents, an older brother and sister as well as a little brother. I played soccer when I was younger and joined my collegeâ€™s soccer club when I got older. My hobbies include things like jigsaw puzzles, reading, and listening to music. I also do a tiny bit of sewing as well, although I am not very good yet. I also LOVE Disney!

                My family is made up of my mom, dad, two older brothers, an older sister, and a little brother. I also have 2 neices and a nephew from my sister. We can't forget my two dogs, their names are Bella and cookie. Fun Fact...my nephew is actually four months older than my little brother, which makes an interesting dynamic between the two.
